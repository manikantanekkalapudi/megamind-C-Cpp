# megamind-C-Cpp - Data Structures and Algorithms notes in C/C++

These examples are disussed in detail on Youtube channel [Corey Schafer](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/).

This repo contains notes and code examples(mostly) from the course. I don't own any of the code in this repository and it's made for my quick reference and to share with anyone who finds it useful. If there are any mistakes or improvements to be done on any of the examples feel free to notify me. This helps a lot!

If you would like to collab on creating something like this on the same repo, please feel free to reach out me at <manikantanekkalapudi@gmail.com>

Thank you!
